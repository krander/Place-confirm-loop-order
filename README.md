# PlaceOrder
Create a new console application. Create an “Order” class. This class should have properties for an order ID, a product name, a quantity, and a date placed. Prompt the user to create a new order, and ask them to enter in a product name and quantity. The order id should automatically increment starting from 1, and the “date placed” should take the current date and time. Then output to the user those details. This app should let them continue to enter as many new orders as they want.
